# IED-Research-Detect-Disarm-AI-Droid
A project exploring the possibilities in the creation of a AI driven robot for detecting IED's in the field, and potential AI - Human driven disarmament. 

# Project Reason, Intentions, Scope.

Due to the cost of purchasing a IED Romote Control Vehicle (wrongly called a robot) being in the region of 100,000$-$280,000 putting machines out of the reach for third-to-second world countries, which predomintly have insurgency issues with a critical exposure to IED's, factored alongside human training within the regions being not on par with well financed countries, thus inability to tackle IED's and/or loss of life.

It was deemed as an area that could potentially be surfaced, and could potentially have a accute impact at dealing with problem, for a reasonable cost.

The project factors in many artificial intelligence systems in a M.A.S Flow, alongside Blockchain (over Enix), and is for exploration in this field at this time, the ideal cost (excluding dev) is approx $1,000 for the 'rig' in consumer/commercial grade chips/frames, this has already been factored in as one of the major saving points opposed to Military Companies internationally known, in respect that in theory the following prices for materials could be achieved.

Consumer Grade (with some commercial grade) $1,000 per Rig
Commercial Grade $5,000 per Rig
Military Grade $10,000 per Rig

In a mass-production arena these costs could come down.

**Remove Control Vrs AI

Removing the human-control to a secondary option would move the IED Detect & Disarm space on massively, this is achieved by building on technologies supplied by Invacio AAP Holdings Ltd for the research project, and/or open-source solutions, alongside developing from the base-up.

The "Droid" if you like to dub it as will be self-driven, and factor in the areas around it as it goes through its motions, from an analytical point of view, the droid is able to capture data points computationally at an exceptional rate compared to a human, however this comes at a cost (computational cycles processing data real-time), which is why the system has seven (7) systems onboard (processing computers), further it is able to access a DB of prior IED's (subject to being infilled) compare against, and even pull into its current process to factor into its decision making.

Initial rig.

The ideology around the initial rig, is cheap/nasty, consumer-grade, thus everything that goes into a proof-of-concept, in this case to provide evidence that the following can be achieved.

1) The Rig could be built initially for less than $1000.
2) The Rig would lead to fine-tuning which could be taken into account if production were to follow for laser-cutting/3D printing.
3) The Rig could be controlled by a AI (Self-Driving) based on environmental events and constraints, whilst carrying out its target work.
4) The AI could seamsless operate fully for its intended purpose (identifying threats, quashing them) from consumer/commercial grade chips/hardware, alongside the analysing AI's being on-board (opposed to remote control - human control).
5) The AI could do more than what a human could achieve within its MAS/AI framework, from the perspective of collating information, deriving information, thus actioning responses.
6) The AI could work much faster and would be prone to less risk opposed to human nerves or error.

I've uploaded some images of the initial (cable tied) opposed to bolted due to still being put together, note this is the first phase of hardware going on and being connected out of mid-fifties.

You will note also additional sensors.

More information, specs, reports, etc will be added in due course.
